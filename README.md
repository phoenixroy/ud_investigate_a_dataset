# Project 3 - Investigate a dataset
This project involves the use of NumPy, Pandas, MatPlotlib, Seaborn and Python to analyse a dataset. The dataset I choose was the Appointments No-Show Dataset.    
This repository contains:    
- a copy of the [Appointments dataset](./no_shows.csv)
- An [iPython Notebook](./appointments_no_shows.ipynb) with my analysis
- A copy of my analysis in [HTML](./appointments_no_shows.html)
